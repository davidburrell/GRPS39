<P/>
 This library gives complete access to the following groups of order 19683:
<List>
<Item>
The rank 1 group
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 2 groups
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 3 groups with p-class not equal to 3
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 4 groups with p-class at least 4
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 5 groups with p-class at least 4
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 6 groups with p-class at least 4
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 7 groups with p-class at least 4
</Item>
<Item>
All rank 8 groups with p-class at least 3
</Item>
<Item>
The rank 9 group
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
 This library gives partial information on the remaining groups of order 19683:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
Rank 3 groups with p-class 3 
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 4 groups with p-class 2
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 4 groups with p-class 3
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 5 groups with p-class 2
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 5 groups with p-class 3
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 6 groups with p-class 2
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 6 groups with p-class 3
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 7 groups with p-class 2
</Item>
<Item>
Rank 7 groups with p-class 3
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
 For the groups that are not explicity available the following information is available:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
Parent Group ID
</Item>
<Item>
Parent Group Order
</Item>
<Item>
p-class
</Item>
<Item>
Rank
</Item>
<Item>
Age
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
 The groups are sorted first by their rank, then by p-class, then by parent group ids and finally by age. The data contained in this library was used in the 2022 enumeration of the groups of order 19683 <Cite Key="Burrell2022a"/>. The computational tools used were developed in the 2021 enumeration of the groups of order 1024 <Cite Key="Burrell2021a"/>. The available groups were generated using the p-group generation algorithm  <Cite Key="OBrien1990a"/> as implemented in the ANUPQ package <Cite Key="Gamble2019a"/>. The information on the remaining groups was calculated using the cohomological methods for enumerating p-groups as introduced in <Cite Key="Eick1999a"/>.
