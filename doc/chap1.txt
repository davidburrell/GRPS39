  [33X[0;0YThe  groups  are  sorted  first by their parent group ids and then by the pc
  codes  of  the  standard presentations for the groups. The data contained in
  this  library  was used in the 2022 enumeration of the groups of order 19683
  [Bur22]. The computational tools used were developed in the 2021 enumeration
  of  the  groups  of  order 1024 [Bur21]. The available groups were generated
  using  the  p-group generation algorithm [O'B90] as implemented in the ANUPQ
  package  [GNOH19].  The  information  on the remaining groups was calculated
  using  the  cohomological  methods for enumerating p-groups as introduced in
  [EO99].[133X
