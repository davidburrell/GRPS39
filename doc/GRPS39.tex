 This library gives complete access to the following groups of order 19683: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  The rank 1 group 
\item  All rank 2 groups 
\item  All rank 3 groups with p-class not equal to 3 
\item  All rank 4 groups with p-class at least 4 
\item  All rank 5 groups with p-class at least 4 
\item  All rank 6 groups with p-class at least 4 
\item  All rank 7 groups with p-class at least 4 
\item  All rank 8 groups with p-class at least 3 
\item  The rank 9 group 
\end{itemize}
 

 This library gives partial information on the remaining groups of order 19683: 

 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Rank 3 groups with p-class 3 
\item  Rank 4 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 4 groups with p-class 3 
\item  Rank 5 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 5 groups with p-class 3 
\item  Rank 6 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 6 groups with p-class 3 
\item  Rank 7 groups with p-class 2 
\item  Rank 7 groups with p-class 3 
\end{itemize}
 

 For the groups that are not explicity available the following information is
available: 

 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Parent Group ID 
\item  Parent Group Order 
\item  p-class 
\item  Rank 
\item  Age 
\end{itemize}
 

 The groups are sorted first by their rank, then by p-class, then by parent
group ids and finally by age. The data contained in this library was used in
the 2022 enumeration of the groups of order 19683 \cite{Burrell2022a}. The computational tools used were developed in the 2021 enumeration of the
groups of order 1024 \cite{Burrell2021a}. The available groups were generated using the p-group generation algorithm \cite{OBrien1990a} as implemented in the ANUPQ package \cite{Gamble2019a}. The information on the remaining groups was calculated using the
cohomological methods for enumerating p-groups as introduced in \cite{Eick1999a}.

 Once the package is loaded the user may call \texttt{SmallGroup(19683,i)} and receive either a group if available or a \emph{partially constructed group} which has the following attributes set 
\begin{itemize}
\item  p-class 
\item  Rank 
\item  Heritage 
\item  Order 
\end{itemize}
 Additional information can be obtained via \texttt{SmallGroupsInformation(19683)}.

of their standard PC codes (the order is determined by the output of the
p-group generation algorithm). }
